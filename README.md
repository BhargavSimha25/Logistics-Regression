# Logistic Regression in Machine Learning 📉

Welcome to the **Logistic Regression in Machine Learning** repository! This project provides resources, examples, and explanations for understanding and implementing logistic regression, a key technique for binary classification problems in machine learning.

## 📚 Overview

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in various applications.
