# Logistic Regression
Welcome to the Logistic Regression repository! This project provides essential resources, tools, and tutorials for understanding and applying logistic regression techniques in various binary classification problems.

### Introduction
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, where the outcome variable has two possible categories (e.g., yes/no, true/false). Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous outcomes, logistic regression predicts the probability of a particular class or event occurring. It is widely used in fields such as medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and marketing analytics.

### Examples
This repository includes various examples to illustrate logistic regression techniques:

Basic Logistic Regression: Introduction to logistic regression with simple binary classification examples.
Model Interpretation: Understanding and interpreting the coefficients of a logistic regression model.
Advanced Techniques: Regularization, handling imbalanced datasets, and feature engineering.
Case Studies: Real-world applications demonstrating the use of logistic regression in different domains.
